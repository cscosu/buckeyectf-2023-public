## Single Note Philosophy

Through extensive focus groups and user surveys, we found that a single note is all that our users needed. This design philosophy keeps our users focused on their most important activities right at the top, all the time.

## Secure yet Powerful

You are the only owner of your notes, which allows you to include your own custom scripting to automate any process you want.

<div id="customElement"></div>

<script>
    const customElement = document.getElementById("customElement");
    setInterval(() => {
        customElement.innerHTML = `<code>${new Date()}</code>`;
    }, 1);
</script>

```html
<div id="customElement"></div>

<script>
  const customElement = document.getElementById("customElement");
  setInterval(() => {
    customElement.innerHTML = `<code>${new Date()}</code>`;
  }, 1);
</script>
```
