        <h1> Kelly Clarkson - Breakaway</h1>
        <p>Da, da, da, da, da, da, da
        <p>Da, da, da, da, da, da
        <p>Da, da, da, da, da, da, da
        <p>Da, da, da, da, da, da, da
        <p>a, da, da, da, da, da</p>
        <p>Da, da, da, da, da, da, da</p>
        <p>Grew up in a small town and when the rain would fall down</p>
        <p>I'd just stare out my window</p>
        <p>Dreaming of what could be and if I'd end up happy</p>
        <p>I would pray (I would pray)</p>
        <p>Trying hard to reach out but when I tried to speak out</p>
        <p>Felt like no one could hear me</p>
        <p>Wanted to belong here but something felt so wrong here</p>
        <p>So, I prayed I could break away</p>
        <p>I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly</p>
        <p>I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky</p>
        <p>And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change and breakaway</p>
        <p>Out of the darkness and into the sun</p>
        <p>But I won't forget all the ones that I love</p>
        <p>I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change and breakaway</p>
        <p>Da, da, da, da, da, da, da</p>
        <p>Da, da, da, da, da, da</p>
        <p>Da, da, da, da, da, da, da</p>
        <p>Wanna feel the warm breeze, sleep under a palm tree</p>
        <p>Feel the rush of the ocean</p>
        <p>Get onboard a fast train, travel on a jet plane, far away and breakaway (I will)</p>
        <p>I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly</p>
        <p>I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky</p>
        <p>And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change and breakaway</p>
        <p>Out of the darkness and into the sun</p>
        <p>But I won't forget all the ones that I love</p>
        <p>I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change and breakaway</p>
        <p>Buildings with a hundred floors, swinging around revolving doors</p>
        <p>Maybe I don't know where they'll take me but</p>
        <p>Gotta keep moving on, moving on, fly away, breakaway</p>
        <p>I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly</p>
        <p>Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye</p>
        <p>I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change and breakaway</p>
        <p>Out of the darkness and into the sun</p>
        <p>But I won't forget the place I come from</p>
        <p>I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change and breakaway</p>
        <p>Breakaway, breakaway</p>
