<p><strong>Skibl</strong> solves the problems other paste services are afraid to solve.</p>

<p>Some services may tell you that you "only need one note" or "notes shouldn't be sharable".
Here at Skribl, we believe that notes are wonderful things.
Why limit something wonderful? Would you like a world with only one flavor of ice cream?</p>

<p>Anyway, notes are a beautiful, and they should be able to be shared.</p>

<p>Skribl offers the best of both worlds. If you don't share your note we <strong>guarantee</strong> that
it will not fall into the wrong hands.</p>
